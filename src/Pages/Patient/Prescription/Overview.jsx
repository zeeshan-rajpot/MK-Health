            <p style={{color:'#747E93'}}>A prescription refill is the process by which one can get a new prescription from a medical provider to get the medications that they are already taking at a pharmacy. Through MK Healthcare, you may be able to get a prescription refill from a licensed medical provider when appropriate to do so.</p>

            <h3><b>Why Get A Prescription Refill</b></h3>
            <p style={{color:'#747E93'}}>

            Most prescription refills are provided by one's existing medical provider. Sometimes, one might need a short-term prescription refill from a new medical provider due to the lack of availability of an appointment with one's regular provider. 
<br /><br />
Another reason might be that the medications have been lost or destroyed. In general, short-term prescription refills can be done at places like a medical clinic, urgent care or online but they are not a substitute for having a regular doctor or other medical provider who can provide ongoing medical care and management.

            <p style={{color:'#747E93'}}>

            Medications that cannot be refilled via an online prescription through a service like MK Health included controlled medications like narcotics or anxiety medications, gabapentin, or any other medication that a medical provider determines would not be appropriate to prescribe through an online evaluation.
 
<br /><br />
Prescription refills can sometimes be done online after the appropriate medical evaluation is performed. Push Health can connect people who need a prescription refill online with a licensed medical provider who can refill a prescription if it is safe and appropriate to do so.
